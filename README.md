## Requirements

The server runs on Node.js. You also need NPM.

You need ImageMagick and zip installed. So this app works anywhere.

APT:

    sudo apt-get install imagemagick zip
    
[Homebrew](http://brewformulas.org/Imagemagick):

    brew install imagemagick zip
    
[Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/packages?q=imagemagick):

    choco install imagemagick zip

## Installation

Clone this repository and run **NPM install**. Then run the server using **node app**.

    npm install
    node app
